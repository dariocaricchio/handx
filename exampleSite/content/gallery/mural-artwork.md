July 2021

It Is a project of mural art sponsored by Philadelphia for 50 years in Italy. Three murales in the heart of Milan, Rome and Catania, cities chosen to represent our entire country.

It Is a mural inspired by the local families, a tribute to neighborhood life and its history - a story of an extended family, with the faces of the families who lived it, the imaginaries that have characterized the landscape and icons of past years
